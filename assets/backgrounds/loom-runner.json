    "name": "Loom-runner",
    "description": "You've always been a bit... different. While others grumbled about the weather or the price of grain, you sometimes found yourself noticing odd things: a shimmer in the air where there shouldn't be one, a distant sound that seemed to come from nowhere, or a feeling of being briefly out of sync with the world. You never called yourself a 'Loom-runner' â€“ you just sometimes felt a strange pull, a sense of unseen currents. Maybe you've accidentally found a peculiar shortcut once or twice, or had vivid dreams that felt more real than waking life. You're perceptive, perhaps a little prone to getting lost in thought, and utterly unprepared for the world suddenly demanding you understand those strange sensations.",
