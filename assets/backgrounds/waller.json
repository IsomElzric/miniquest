    "description": "Your hands were mostly occupied with the upkeep of the settlement's humble defenses - mending a cracked foundation, replacing loose stones on the animal pens, or perhaps helping to patch a section of the outer palisade after a particularly rough storm. You know how to mix a solid mortar, the importance of a straight line, and the subtle ways wood rots or stone crumbles. You're a patient, methodical sort, used to working piece by painstaking piece to build something that lasts. The idea of fighting anything larger than a persistent draft coming through a wall is certainly not something you prepared for. A resilient survivor, hardened by adversity and possessing an unyielding will to live. Endurance is your greatest asset.",
