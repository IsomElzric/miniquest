A **Sewer-lurker** is the embodiment of rot and forgotten filth, a creature adapted to the Stygian depths beneath Lastholm. It is rarely seen, more often sensed through the slime it leaves behind and the putrid stench that heralds its presence.
Its body is a repulsive mass, roughly serpentine or eel-like, but disturbingly thick and muscled, tapering to a powerful, paddle-like tail. Its skin is not scales, but a slick, **dark grey or mottled green hide**, perpetually glistening with a foul-smelling film of sludge and decaying organic matter. This hide is tough and resilient, scarred from encounters in its lightless domain, and often encrusted with strange, phosphorescent fungi that glow faintly in the dark.
The head of a Sewer-lurker is wedge-shaped and flat, designed to navigate narrow passages. Its eyes, if present, are tiny and vestigial, perhaps milky white or completely absent, as it relies on other senses. Instead, its most prominent feature is a wide, lipless maw lined with rows of **needle-sharp, translucent teeth**, often stained brown or yellow from its diet. Long, sensitive **barbels or whiskers** extend from its snout, constantly twitching, picking up vibrations and the faintest chemical trails in the stagnant water.
It moves with an unnerving, silent fluidity through the muck and shallow currents, able to slither with surprising speed. When it surfaces, it often does so without a ripple, only its unwholesome stench betraying its presence. It produces a soft, **gurgling hiss** when agitated, like water being forced through a clogged pipe, or the wet, **slurping sound** of something moving through thick sludge. The air around it is thick with the overpowering smell of **foul water, stagnant decay, and raw sewage**, a stench that clings to everything it touches.
