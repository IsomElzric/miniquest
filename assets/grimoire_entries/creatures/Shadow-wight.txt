A **Shadow-wight** is the chilling embodiment of the Aethelwood's darkest, most suffocating gloom, a spectral predator that exists almost entirely as a void within the oppressive shadows. It is not merely an undead spirit, but a fragment of the forest's eternal night given malicious sentience.
Its form is a perpetually shifting, vaguely humanoid silhouette, more an absence of light than a solid body. It appears as an incredibly gaunt, elongated figure draped in what seems to be **coalesced darkness**, which constantly writhes and flows like heavy smoke. Light seems to *bend* around it, and the area immediately surrounding a Shadow-wight is always darker, deeper than the already oppressive gloom of the Aethelwood. You might glimpse skeletal limbs composed of pure shadow, ending in long, impossibly sharp **claws of ethereal darkness** that seem capable of tearing at your very essence.
Its 'face' is usually a featureless void, or perhaps just two pinpricks of **cold, spectral white or icy blue light** deep within its shadowy cowl, eyes that observe with an ancient, malevolent cunning. There's no texture to its 'skin,' only the profound, unsettling depth of shadow.
The Shadow-wight moves with an unnerving, **utter silence**, gliding over the forest floor as if it possesses no weight, or dissolving into the deeper gloom only to reappear somewhere else with disconcerting speed. Its presence causes a sudden, profound **drop in temperature**, sucking the warmth from the air and from your very bones. You might hear a faint, almost imperceptible **dry whisper**, like desiccated leaves scuttling across stone, or the sound of dying embers, that seems to emanate from all around you, not just the creature itself. There is often no scent, or only the faint, unsettling smell of ozone and grave earth, but more often, it simply smells like the *absence* of anything living.
It is a hunter of vitality and hope, feeding on the fading spark of life, a creature perfectly adapted to the Aethelwood's eternal night, waiting patiently for its prey to stumble into its inky embrace.
