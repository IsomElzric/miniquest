A **Gnarled Horror** is a monstrous effigy of the Aethelwood's ancient, suffocating embrace, a walking nightmare woven from the very fabric of the haunted forest. It is a hulking, roughly humanoid shape, but one grotesquely distorted and organic, as if a tree decided to walk and scream.
Its entire form is composed of **intertwined, ancient wood**, thick and dense as petrified timber, yet clearly imbued with unnatural life. Its 'skin' is a rough, fissured bark, dark as shadowed earth, often weeping sticky, black sap from deep crevices. Skeletal branches, thick and splintered like broken bones, form its disproportionately long limbs, terminating in brutal, knotty fists or rake-like claws of sharpened wood. Twisted roots, thick as cables, writhe across its 'body' like sinews, sometimes piercing through its bark exterior. Sickly, phosphorescent moss or peculiar fungi might cling to its crevices, adding to its unsettling glow in the perpetual gloom.
Its head is a crude, bark-covered mass, often without discernible features beyond two deep-set, lightless hollows where eyes might be, or perhaps a single, baleful **glow of sickly green or bruised purple**, like captured starlight from the canopy above. A gaping maw, if it possesses one, is a jagged tear in the wood, filled with splintered, tooth-like protrusions.
Every movement is accompanied by the **groaning and creaking of ancient timber**, a sound like a forest slowly tearing itself apart from within. The air around it carries the heavy scent of **damp earth, old wood, and a bitter, metallic tang** that hints at the forest's deeper, darker essence. It feels less like a beast and more like a punishment, an inexorable manifestation of the Aethelwood's profound and ancient malice.
