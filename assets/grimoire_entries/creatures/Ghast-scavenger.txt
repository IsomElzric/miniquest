A **Ghast-scavenger** is less a solid creature and more a living famine given form, a blight clinging to the remnants of both flesh and spirit.
Its body is a sickening study in emaciation and insubstantiality. It appears as a gaunt, perpetually hunched humanoid, its frame draped in tattered, clinging shadows rather than skin. Where its flesh should be, there is often only a translucent, sickly sheen, like a faint, greasy film over bone. Ribs protrude starkly, not merely from thinness, but as if they are brittle, ancient twigs barely held together. Its limbs are unnaturally long and spindly, ending in hands equipped with a disturbing number of elongated, **razor-sharp claws** that seem more akin to surgical instruments than natural appendages, constantly twitching as if seeking something to pick apart.
Its head is a skull-like mask, sunken eyesockets burning with a dim, phosphorescent glow—a hungry, vacant light. Its jaw is perpetually agape, revealing not teeth, but a series of thin, pointed projections and a preternaturally long, barbed tongue that constantly flicks out, tasting the unseen motes in the air.
Movement for a Ghast-scavenger is unnervingly silent and unnaturally swift; it doesn't walk so much as *skulk* and *dart*, often appearing to phase slightly in and out of full visibility, leaving momentary cold spots in its wake. There's no sound of footsteps, only the faint, dry **clattering** of its own brittle form and a pervasive, almost imperceptible **whisper** that seems to emanate from its very presence, like a thousand starved voices sighing. The air around it often carries a faint, sickening scent of dust, decay, and something else – something metallic and stale, like a forgotten tomb.
It feeds not just on carrion, but on the lingering echoes of life, the fading memories of pain, and the last vestiges of warmth from those on the brink of death. It is a creature of opportunistic hunger, drawn to weakness and despair.
