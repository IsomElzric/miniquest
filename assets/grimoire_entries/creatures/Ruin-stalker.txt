A **Ruin-stalker** is less an inhabitant of shattered places and more an extension of them, a predator that has become indistinguishable from the decay itself. It is a creature of unsettling stillness and sudden, brutal motion, a silent hunter of forgotten corners.
Its form is a study in angular camouflage, a body built for silent navigation through collapsing structures. It might be vaguely reptilian or arachnid in its low-slung, multi-limbed posture, but its true horror lies in its seamless integration with its environment. Its hide is not scales or fur, but a living, shifting mosaic of **cracked plaster, eroded brick, and jagged shards of dark stone**, mimicking the very debris it moves through. Patches of **dry moss and grey dust** cling naturally to its surface, enhancing its natural camouflage. Its limbs are long, slender, and unnaturally articulated, ending in wide, multi-jointed digits or segmented claws that can grip the most precarious edges, allowing it to cling to crumbling walls or scuttle across unstable rubble without a sound.
Its head is often small, low-slung, and almost featureless, designed to merge with a broken outline. Its eyes, however, are chillingly alive â€“ often multiple, multifaceted, and glowing with a dull, predatory gleam like polished obsidian, capable of discerning the slightest movement in perpetual gloom.
A Ruin-stalker moves with an **eerie, almost ghostly silence**, a faint, dry *scritch* of stone on stone being the only sound it might make as it shifts its weight. It can remain absolutely motionless for hours, a perfect silhouette against a broken archway or a forgotten heap of rubble, becoming just another part of the ruins until it strikes. The air around it might carry the faint, dry scent of **dust, damp concrete, and stagnant air**, the very smell of decay.
It is the spirit of crumbling abandonment given flesh, a patient hunter that waits for its prey to mistake it for just another shadow in the desolate heart of a forgotten city.
