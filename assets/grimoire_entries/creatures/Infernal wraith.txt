An **Infernal Wraith** is a horrifying manifestation of Shadowsun's deepest, most Malevolent energies, a true spirit of destruction and suffering forged in the volcano's searing heart. It is less a creature and more a living vortex of pure, consuming heat and suffocating despair.
Its appearance is utterly terrifying: a constantly shifting, vaguely humanoid pillar of **blackened, shimmering heat-haze and swirling, dark flames**. It is not merely on fire; it *is* fire, a sentient vortex of incandescent gas and superheated ash that absorbs light even as it glows. Within its rippling form, you might glimpse the faint, tormented outline of a colossal figure, its 'body' seemingly wreathed in shadows that are somehow *hotter* than the light around them. Tendrils of **smoldering, dark energy** constantly writhe from its form, reaching out like phantom limbs.
Where its eyes should be, two points of **blinding, molten white or obsidian-black light** burn with an ancient, malevolent intelligence, searing your very soul if you gaze upon them. Its 'limbs' are indistinct, but capable of solidifying into immense, crushing force, searing any matter they touch to instantaneous ash.
The Infernal Wraith moves with an terrifying, almost silent **surge**, its passage accompanied by an overwhelming, guttural **roar that sounds like a thousand furnaces igniting at once**, or the deep, unsettling **hiss of superheated air being violently displaced**. Its presence brings with it an unbearable, suffocating wave of **intense, dry heat** that makes the air feel impossibly thin, stealing breath from the lungs. The air around it is thick with the acrid stench of **burning sulfur, scorched flesh, and raw, elemental malice**, a smell that promises instant combustion. It is a relentless, unstoppable force, a pure engine of devastation that embodies the crushing, soul-searing power of Shadowsun's inferno.Okay, from the grand fury of the Ash-Revenant to the more numerous, insidious threat! A "Cinder-spawn" is a perfect fit for the volcano's lesser, but still deadly, denizens.
