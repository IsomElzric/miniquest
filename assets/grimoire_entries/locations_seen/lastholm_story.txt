"Lastholm, eh? You wanna know 'bout Lastholm?" The thug's eyes, red-rimmed and distant, seemed to fix on something beyond the dingy barroom walls. He took a long pull from his tankard, wiping his mouth with the back of a grimy hand.

"It ain't just a ruin, see? Most ruins, they're just... empty. Lastholm, though... that place feels wrong. Like it's still breathing, but with a rotten lung. You smell it before you even get close â€“ a mix of damp earth, rust, and somethin' sweet and sickly, like flowers on a corpse."

He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a gravelly whisper. "They say whatever killed it ain't gone. Left its mark everywhere. The Front Gates ain't guarding anything but graves, twisted iron jaws gnawing at the air. And inside... Gods, the inside."

"The Market Quarter? More like a junk heap. Stalls torn apart, goods rotted to mush. You can almost hear the screams of folks runnin' from... whatever it was. And the Guildhalls? Big stone husks, yeah, but you can feel the desperation clingin' to 'em like a shroud. Like the folks inside knew it was comin', but couldn't stop it."

He shivered, despite the warmth of the ale. "The Docks... the water there's black as pitch, and somethin' moves under the surface, I swear it. And the Gardens... don't let the name fool ya. Them plants ain't pretty. They're like claws, pullin' everything down, suckin' the life out of the stone statues, out of you if you ain't careful. And the trees? They look like they're crying, always drippin' something foul."

"But the worst part? The Temples. Big, empty holes in the sky. Altars smashed, holy symbols defiled. Like whatever happened, it hated everything good. And the Residential Blocks... that's where it really hits you. Just empty shells, but you can almost smell the fear in 'em. A kid's toy, a cracked teacup... little things left behind by folks who just vanished. Makes your skin crawl, knowin' they never came back."

"And if you're dumb enough to go into the Undercity... well, you earned whatever you find down there. Darker than a witch's soul, smells like death and things you don't wanna think about. Full of whispers, too. Like the city itself is still moanin' its last breath."

He slammed his tankard down, sloshing ale onto the table. "Don't go to Lastholm, friend. It's not abandoned. It's just... waiting."
