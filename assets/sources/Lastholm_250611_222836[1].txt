A **Stone-flesh Golem** is a horrific, unnatural union, a testament to forbidden arts. Imagine a hulking, roughly humanoid shape, but one that seems to have been built from the very earth and then crudely animated with stolen life.
Its form is a grotesque patchwork: immense, dull grey **boulders** and jagged slabs of **granite** make up the bulk of its limbs and torso, seemingly fused together without mortar. But in the gaps, stretching over the stone, and sometimes erupting from it, is **pallid, scarred flesh**. This isn't healthy skin; it's thick and rubbery in some places, raw and exposed in others, often a sickly off-white or mottled grey-pink, like muscle torn from a colossal beast and haphazardly grafted onto stone.
Wherever stone meets flesh, the connection looks agonizingly forced – tendons might strain over sharp rock edges, or jagged shards of stone protrude through stretched skin. Its head is a crude, stony mass, perhaps with two small, vacant pits for eyes that glow with a faint, malevolent light, and a gaping, toothless maw that hints at immense crushing power.
Every movement is a symphony of unnatural sounds: the **grinding of stone** against stone, the **wet squelch** of strained flesh, and a low, guttural **rumble** from deep within its core. The air around it might carry the faint scent of dust, damp earth, and something metallic, like stale blood or ozone.
It's a creature of immense, brutish strength, lumbering forward with unstoppable intent, a living embodiment of the earth's stubbornness and life's agonizing resilience.

A **Ghast-scavenger** is less a solid creature and more a living famine given form, a blight clinging to the remnants of both flesh and spirit.
Its body is a sickening study in emaciation and insubstantiality. It appears as a gaunt, perpetually hunched humanoid, its frame draped in tattered, clinging shadows rather than skin. Where its flesh should be, there is often only a translucent, sickly sheen, like a faint, greasy film over bone. Ribs protrude starkly, not merely from thinness, but as if they are brittle, ancient twigs barely held together. Its limbs are unnaturally long and spindly, ending in hands equipped with a disturbing number of elongated, **razor-sharp claws** that seem more akin to surgical instruments than natural appendages, constantly twitching as if seeking something to pick apart.
Its head is a skull-like mask, sunken eyesockets burning with a dim, phosphorescent glow—a hungry, vacant light. Its jaw is perpetually agape, revealing not teeth, but a series of thin, pointed projections and a preternaturally long, barbed tongue that constantly flicks out, tasting the unseen motes in the air.
Movement for a Ghast-scavenger is unnervingly silent and unnaturally swift; it doesn't walk so much as *skulk* and *dart*, often appearing to phase slightly in and out of full visibility, leaving momentary cold spots in its wake. There's no sound of footsteps, only the faint, dry **clattering** of its own brittle form and a pervasive, almost imperceptible **whisper** that seems to emanate from its very presence, like a thousand starved voices sighing. The air around it often carries a faint, sickening scent of dust, decay, and something else – something metallic and stale, like a forgotten tomb.
It feeds not just on carrion, but on the lingering echoes of life, the fading memories of pain, and the last vestiges of warmth from those on the brink of death. It is a creature of opportunistic hunger, drawn to weakness and despair.

A **Bone-gnawer** is a creature of pure, relentless hunger, perpetually starved and driven by an insatiable craving for marrow and calcified remnants. It's a scavenger perfected for consuming what others leave behind, and what others *can't* consume.
Its form is sinewy and low to the ground, built for relentless pursuit and burrowing into tight spaces. Imagine a grotesque canine or hyena-like beast, but one cobbled together from scavenged remains. Its hide is a patchwork of leathery, scarred skin stretched taut over an unnaturally prominent skeleton. You can see the **knobs of its spine** clearly, the sharp angles of its ribs, and the jutting bones of its hips and shoulders. Its legs are powerful and bowed, ending in oversized, calloused paws with blunt, but incredibly strong **claws** for digging and clinging.
The most striking feature is its head: disproportionately large, with powerful, **crushing jaws** that seem to grin perpetually. Its teeth are not pointed like a predator's, but thick, blunt, and worn down, designed for immense pressure, capable of splintering femurs or grinding stone to powder. Its eyes are sunken and small, glowing with a dull, obsessive hunger, often darting about frantically, searching. Its ears might be torn and ragged, constantly twitching to catch the faint *clink* of bone.
It moves with an unnerving, scurrying gait, often accompanied by a **dry, rattling clatter** as its gaunt frame flexes. The air around a Bone-gnawer often carries a faint, sickening scent of dust, old blood, and the distinct, cloying odor of **decaying marrow**. Its singular purpose is evident in every twitch and gnaw: to find, break, and consume the toughest remnants, leaving nothing but dust in its wake.

A **Ruin-stalker** is less an inhabitant of shattered places and more an extension of them, a predator that has become indistinguishable from the decay itself. It is a creature of unsettling stillness and sudden, brutal motion, a silent hunter of forgotten corners.
Its form is a study in angular camouflage, a body built for silent navigation through collapsing structures. It might be vaguely reptilian or arachnid in its low-slung, multi-limbed posture, but its true horror lies in its seamless integration with its environment. Its hide is not scales or fur, but a living, shifting mosaic of **cracked plaster, eroded brick, and jagged shards of dark stone**, mimicking the very debris it moves through. Patches of **dry moss and grey dust** cling naturally to its surface, enhancing its natural camouflage. Its limbs are long, slender, and unnaturally articulated, ending in wide, multi-jointed digits or segmented claws that can grip the most precarious edges, allowing it to cling to crumbling walls or scuttle across unstable rubble without a sound.
Its head is often small, low-slung, and almost featureless, designed to merge with a broken outline. Its eyes, however, are chillingly alive – often multiple, multifaceted, and glowing with a dull, predatory gleam like polished obsidian, capable of discerning the slightest movement in perpetual gloom.
A Ruin-stalker moves with an **eerie, almost ghostly silence**, a faint, dry *scritch* of stone on stone being the only sound it might make as it shifts its weight. It can remain absolutely motionless for hours, a perfect silhouette against a broken archway or a forgotten heap of rubble, becoming just another part of the ruins until it strikes. The air around it might carry the faint, dry scent of **dust, damp concrete, and stagnant air**, the very smell of decay.
It is the spirit of crumbling abandonment given flesh, a patient hunter that waits for its prey to mistake it for just another shadow in the desolate heart of a forgotten city.

A **Sewer-lurker** is the embodiment of rot and forgotten filth, a creature adapted to the Stygian depths beneath Lastholm. It is rarely seen, more often sensed through the slime it leaves behind and the putrid stench that heralds its presence.
Its body is a repulsive mass, roughly serpentine or eel-like, but disturbingly thick and muscled, tapering to a powerful, paddle-like tail. Its skin is not scales, but a slick, **dark grey or mottled green hide**, perpetually glistening with a foul-smelling film of sludge and decaying organic matter. This hide is tough and resilient, scarred from encounters in its lightless domain, and often encrusted with strange, phosphorescent fungi that glow faintly in the dark.
The head of a Sewer-lurker is wedge-shaped and flat, designed to navigate narrow passages. Its eyes, if present, are tiny and vestigial, perhaps milky white or completely absent, as it relies on other senses. Instead, its most prominent feature is a wide, lipless maw lined with rows of **needle-sharp, translucent teeth**, often stained brown or yellow from its diet. Long, sensitive **barbels or whiskers** extend from its snout, constantly twitching, picking up vibrations and the faintest chemical trails in the stagnant water.
It moves with an unnerving, silent fluidity through the muck and shallow currents, able to slither with surprising speed. When it surfaces, it often does so without a ripple, only its unwholesome stench betraying its presence. It produces a soft, **gurgling hiss** when agitated, like water being forced through a clogged pipe, or the wet, **slurping sound** of something moving through thick sludge. The air around it is thick with the overpowering smell of **foul water, stagnant decay, and raw sewage**, a stench that clings to everything it touches.
