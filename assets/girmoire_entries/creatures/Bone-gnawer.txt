A **Bone-gnawer** is a creature of pure, relentless hunger, perpetually starved and driven by an insatiable craving for marrow and calcified remnants. It's a scavenger perfected for consuming what others leave behind, and what others *can't* consume.
Its form is sinewy and low to the ground, built for relentless pursuit and burrowing into tight spaces. Imagine a grotesque canine or hyena-like beast, but one cobbled together from scavenged remains. Its hide is a patchwork of leathery, scarred skin stretched taut over an unnaturally prominent skeleton. You can see the **knobs of its spine** clearly, the sharp angles of its ribs, and the jutting bones of its hips and shoulders. Its legs are powerful and bowed, ending in oversized, calloused paws with blunt, but incredibly strong **claws** for digging and clinging.
The most striking feature is its head: disproportionately large, with powerful, **crushing jaws** that seem to grin perpetually. Its teeth are not pointed like a predator's, but thick, blunt, and worn down, designed for immense pressure, capable of splintering femurs or grinding stone to powder. Its eyes are sunken and small, glowing with a dull, obsessive hunger, often darting about frantically, searching. Its ears might be torn and ragged, constantly twitching to catch the faint *clink* of bone.
It moves with an unnerving, scurrying gait, often accompanied by a **dry, rattling clatter** as its gaunt frame flexes. The air around a Bone-gnawer often carries a faint, sickening scent of dust, old blood, and the distinct, cloying odor of **decaying marrow**. Its singular purpose is evident in every twitch and gnaw: to find, break, and consume the toughest remnants, leaving nothing but dust in its wake.
