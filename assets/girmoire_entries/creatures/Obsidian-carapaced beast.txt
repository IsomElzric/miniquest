An **Obsidian-Carapaced Beast** is a colossal, primordial force of the Shadowsun volcano, a living, walking fortress carved from the very magma and rock of the mountain itself. It is a creature of immense, unyielding power, embodying the raw, geological might of its fiery home.
Its body is of truly immense size, often roughly quadrupedal or hexapodal, with a low-slung, incredibly broad chassis. Its most defining feature is its **formidable, multi-layered carapace, composed entirely of jagged, razor-sharp plates of jet-black obsidian**. These natural armor segments are not smooth; they are rough, fractured, and glint wickedly with every shift, their edges capable of shearing through solid rock. In the deeper fissures and cracks between these plates, an ominous **red or orange glow** often pulses, hinting at the molten heat that courses just beneath its armored hide.
Its limbs are thick, pillar-like columns of hardened volcanic rock and dark, leathery flesh, ending in blunt, crushing feet or splayed, spade-like claws, perfectly designed to traverse fresh lava flows and shattered bedrock. Its head is often broad and low, a blunt instrument of destruction, with eyes that are small, unblinking chips of **hardened, glowing magma**, radiating a dull, ancient malevolence. From its powerful maw, short, blunt obsidian teeth might protrude, designed for grinding rather than tearing.
The Obsidian-Carapaced Beast moves with a slow, ponderous, but unstoppable momentum. Each step is punctuated by a heavy, rhythmic **thud-thud-thud** that makes the very ground tremble, accompanied by the chilling **grinding *screech* of its obsidian plates** as they shift and rub against each other. It radiates a powerful, pervasive **dry heat** that distorts the air around it, and the air carries the scent of **scorched stone, sulfur, and the metallic tang of superheated minerals**. It is a creature of primal force and impenetrable defense, an unstoppable juggernaut of living volcanic rock that few can hope to stand against.Okay, "Infernal Wraith" is a truly menacing name for a creature born from Shadowsun! This sounds like a top-tier threat.
