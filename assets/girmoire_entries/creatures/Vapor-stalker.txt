A **Vapor-stalker** is an elusive and terrifying predator born directly from the superheated breath of the Scorlends, a creature that embodies the deceptive, searing essence of volcanic steam and blistering heat. It is a ghost woven from the very air, a master of concealment and sudden, scalding strikes.
Its form is perpetually indistinct, a **shimmering, wavering distortion** in the heat-haze that seems to constantly swirl and reform. It typically appears as a gaunt, serpentine, or vaguely reptilian outline, but never fully solidifies, constantly appearing to be composed of **coalesced steam, shimmering light, and agitated volcanic gases**. You might glimpse what seems to be a slender, elongated body, perhaps with wispy, clawed appendages that appear and disappear as the vapor shifts. Within its translucent form, a faint, internal glow of **molten orange or dull crimson** might pulse, hinting at the intense heat it radiates.
Its 'head' is often a blurry, indistinct shape, with 'eyes' that are merely areas of more intense heat-distortion, or two glowing, **pinprick embers** that seem to float unsettlingly within the vapor. It carries no discernible texture, only the ephemeral, iridescent shimmer of heat distortion.
The Vapor-stalker moves with an unnerving, near-silent grace, drifting through the rocky outcrops and ash dunes as if carried by an unseen current. Its passage is marked by a sudden, intense blast of **dry, searing heat** that can make the air shimmer and shimmer, and a faint, almost imperceptible **hissing sound**, like steam escaping a pressure vent. There is no particular scent to it, save for the clean, sterile smell of extreme heat and a subtle hint of ozone. Its presence disorients, causing the air to feel strangely thin and causing one to instinctively seek stable ground, making its sudden, scalding strikes all the more terrifying. It is a silent hunter, a mirage of death that blends seamlessly with the scorching desolation of the Scorlends.Here comes your favorite! Given the description of the Scorlends, a "Sulphur-crawler" is absolutely perfect, embodying the very essence of that corrosive, volcanic wasteland.
