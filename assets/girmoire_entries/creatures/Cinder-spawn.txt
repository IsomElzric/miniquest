A **Cinder-spawn** is a living, aggressive fragment of Shadowsun's molten core, a miniature engine of destruction born directly from the volcano's burning heart. It is a testament to the mountain's ability to imbue even its smallest remnants with a volatile, destructive life.
Its form is small, roughly the size of a large dog or a crawling insect, but terrifyingly active. It appears as a perpetually shifting, **glowing mass of superheated cinders, jagged shards of obsidian, and blackened, hardened magma**. Its 'body' constantly crackles and sizzles, with tiny, incandescent **sparks and embers visibly flaring and dying** as it moves. There's no true 'skin,' only the raw, abrasive surfaces of burning volcanic debris held together by some unseen, internal heat.
Its 'limbs' are short, stubby protrusions of solidified lava and sharp rock, ending in blunt, burning claws that scorch the ground with every skittering step. Its 'head' is often just a slightly denser cluster of glowing material, with eyes that are merely two brighter, malevolent pinpricks of **molten orange or vibrant red**, burning with unthinking aggression. A constantly shifting maw of red-hot cinders may open and close, revealing no true teeth but a hungry void.
The Cinder-spawn moves with an erratic, skittering gait, accompanied by a constant, sharp **crackling and sizzling sound**, like a burning log violently consumed by fire, interspersed with the faint, gritty *scritch* of cinders against rock. It radiates an intense, blistering **dry heat** that distorts the air around it and occasionally sends stinging sparks flying. The air around it is thick with the smell of **burning rock, scorched sulfur, and hot ash**, a raw, acrid scent that feels like a physical burn in the lungs. It is a volatile, aggressive entity, a living, burning hazard that embodies the uncontrolled, fiery fury of Shadowsun's cinders.Okay, we're diving into the heart of the devastation! The Shadowsun volcano is the perfect stage for the most intense threats. An "Ash-Revenant" is a brilliant starting point for its inhabitants.
