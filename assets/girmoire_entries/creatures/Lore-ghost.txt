A **Lore-ghost** is not merely the spirit of a departed individual, but a spectral echo of the Aethelwood's ancient, buried truths and forgotten secrets, given chilling form. It is less a physical presence and more a living archive of sorrow and wisdom, animated by the crushing weight of lost time.
Its appearance is perpetually ephemeral, a shimmering, translucent outline of a vaguely humanoid figure, constantly wavering as if seen through heat haze or rippling water. Its form is not just mist; it's a swirling tapestry of **faint, illegible script, decaying parchment-like textures, and fleeting, sorrowful images** that seem to flicker within its translucent mass. You might glimpse fragments of ancient symbols, spectral maps, or fleeting faces within its indistinct 'body'.
Its 'face' is usually a featureless void, or perhaps an empty hood, but its 'eyes' (if they can be called that) are two points of **cold, piercing blue or silver light**, radiating a profound, ancient sorrow or a hungry, analytical intelligence. Ethereal, shadowy 'hands' might extend from its form, constantly tracing invisible symbols in the air, or reaching out as if to grasp fading memories.
The Lore-ghost moves with an unsettling, **silent drift**, gliding through the dense undergrowth without disturbing a single leaf, or flickering between the ancient trees with the speed of thought. Its presence is marked by an sudden, intense **drop in temperature**, a chilling psychic cold that seeps into your bones, and a profound, oppressive **silence** that seems to swallow all other sounds. Occasionally, a faint, almost imperceptible **whisper** might seem to emanate from all around you, like countless dusty pages turning in unison, or the echo of forgotten, mournful voices. The air around it often carries the musty scent of old books, damp earth, and an unsettling, sterile cold.
It is a guardian of what should remain buried, a living, ethereal repository of the Aethelwood's long-lost tales, and its touch is not physical, but intellectual â€“ threatening to overwhelm the mind with the sheer burden of its ancient knowledge.Okay, excellent! "Gnarled Horror" is a fantastic name for a creature of the Aethelwood. It immediately conjures images of twisted wood and ancient malevolence.
