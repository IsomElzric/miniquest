A **Root-bound Abomination** is a living, screaming testament to the Aethelwood's relentless, suffocating power. It is not merely a creature caught in the roots, but a monstrous, tragic union of unfortunate flesh and the forest's ancient, malevolent will.
Its form is a grotesque, hulking mass, vaguely humanoid or beastial, but utterly consumed and reshaped by the forest's pervasive grasp. Thick, **blackened roots**, coarse as ancient ropes, form a suffocating, Gordian knot around and *through* its original body. These roots are not passive bonds; they constrict, pierce, and contort its form, acting as sinews and bones for a new, horrifying anatomy. Patches of **pallid, decaying flesh** —what remains of the original creature—are visible in gaps between the woody tangles, often bruised purple or sickly grey, perpetually weeping dark, viscous fluids. Jagged splinters of wood might protrude from these fleshy wounds.
Its limbs are massive, root-like appendages, ending in blunt, crushing clubs or splayed, grasping claws, propelled by the immense, straining power of the forest. The 'head' is often a distorted, half-formed agony, perhaps a mangled skull or a bark-encrusted visage with a permanently open maw. Its 'eyes,' if discernible, are usually dim, sunken pits of profound suffering or raw, unthinking rage, flickering faintly with a captive, sickly green light.
Every movement is a slow, agonizing **groan of straining wood and wet tearing sounds** from within its own bound form. The ground trembles faintly with its ponderous steps, accompanied by the deep, resonant **creak of ancient timber** under immense pressure. The air around it is heavy with the scent of **damp, rotting wood, bitter sap, and the chilling tang of decay**, a powerful, earthy stench that speaks of a millennia of slow corruption.
It is a prisoner and a puppet, an entity driven by eternal torment and the silent, hungry will of the Aethelwood itself, a creature of overwhelming, brute force and endless, agonizing despair.
