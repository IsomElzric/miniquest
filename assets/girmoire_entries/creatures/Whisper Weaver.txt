A **Whisper-weaver** is less a creature of brute force and more a living tapestry of the Aethelwood's insidious whispers and psychological dread. It is an unseen artisan of paranoia, using the very sounds and silences of the ancient forest as its loom.
Its true form is rarely, if ever, seen clearly. It is often perceived as a fleeting, **blurry distortion in the air**, a shimmering heat-haze that seems to warp the background, or a silhouette that subtly shifts, never quite resolving into a definable shape. When it does coalesce, it appears as an incredibly gaunt, almost arachnid-like being, comprised of a knot of **shadows and translucent, filament-thin tendrils** that seem to absorb ambient light. Its 'skin' might appear as an ancient, papery bark, or merely the absence of detail against the deeper gloom. Its most discernible features are often a cluster of unnaturally large, membranous **ear-like structures or vibrating antennae**, constantly shifting and twitching, absorbing every subtle vibration.
The Whisper-weaver doesn't move with footsteps, but with an **eerie, almost imperceptible *thrumming* or a dry, papery rustle** as its delicate filaments brush against the air. Its true danger lies in its mastery of sound. It can conjure sudden, absolute **silences** that press in on the mind, or fill the air with disorienting, overlapping **whispers**: faint, mournful cries of lost souls, distorted echoes of your own thoughts, the distant snap of a twig where there is nothing, or even the chilling sound of something *else* moving just out of sight.
The air around it might carry the faint scent of damp moss and static electricity, but more powerfully, it resonates with a **subtle, creeping sense of dread** and disquiet. It preys not on flesh, but on sanity, weaving a psychological web of fear and disorientation that lures its victims deeper into the Aethelwood's crushing embrace.
