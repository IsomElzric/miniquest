An **Ash-Revenant** is the vengeful spirit of Shadowsun itself, a terrifying manifestation of the volcano's unending wrath and scorching desolation. It is not merely a creature of ash, but a fragment of the mountain's destructive soul given malevolent form.
Its appearance is a horrifying spectacle of constant, internal turmoil. It coalesces from the very air as a **glowing, roughly humanoid silhouette, perpetually wreathed in a swirling, superheated vortex of fine volcanic ash and glowing embers**. Its 'body' is never truly solid, constantly dissolving and reforming, making it seem both insubstantial and utterly terrifyingly real. Within its turbulent form, you might glimpse suggestions of blackened, skeletal limbs or the faint, tortured outline of a face, but these details are always fleeting, consumed and reshaped by the roiling ash.
Where its eyes should be, two points of **intense, molten orange or volcanic red light** burn with an unholy intensity, piercing through the smoky haze like twin furnaces. Its 'limbs' are capable of solidifying with surprising force, delivering blows that feel like being struck by a blast of scorching grit and burning coals.
The Ash-Revenant moves with a terrifying, almost soundless glide, accompanied only by the ceaseless, dry **whisper and *scritch* of millions of grinding ash particles**, like a sandstorm trapped within a living form. Its very presence causes the air to shimmer with intense **radiant heat**, making it difficult to breathe, and carrying an overwhelming scent of **scorched earth, acrid sulfur, and fresh, hot ash**, thick enough to choke. It is a relentless, burning judgment, a harbinger of Shadowsun's enduring fury, impossible to gaze upon without feeling the desperate urge to flee its searing touch.
