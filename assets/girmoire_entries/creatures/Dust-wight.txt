A **Dust-wight** is the desiccated ghost of the Scorlends, a spectral horror formed from the very ash and sorrow of the broken lands. It is a terrifying manifestation of lingering despair and the unending thirst of the barren wastes.
Its form is a perpetually swirling, gaunt humanoid silhouette, composed entirely of **fine, agitated ash and pulverized rock particles**. It is not solid, yet it is utterly corporeal enough to interact with the world. Its 'body' is a living vortex of dust, constantly churning and shifting, making its precise outlines impossible to discern. Within this shifting cloud, you might perceive the faint, skeletal structure of what was once a living being â€“ bone-like protrusions of coalesced grit, or hollows where organs once resided.
Its 'face' is a perpetually blurred mask of swirling dust, with two sunken, featureless voids serving as eyes, from which a faint, cold, **ochre glow** might sometimes flicker, like distant embers. Its limbs are shapeless extensions of churning dust, ending in wispy, grasping appendages that seem capable of sucking the moisture from the very air. Light does not reflect off a Dust-wight; it seems to be partially absorbed, making the area around it appear hazy and indistinct, as if viewed through a perpetual sandstorm.
The Dust-wight moves with an unsettling, **dry whisper**, like sand shifting on a vast dune, accompanied by the faint, gritty *scritch* of fine particles grinding against each other. It carries with it an overwhelming scent of **stale, ancient dust and mineral decay**, a smell of extreme desiccation that seems to leach moisture from your throat. Its presence is marked by an immediate and profound **dryness in the air**, a suffocating sensation that promises to erode not just flesh, but spirit. It is a hunter of life, seeking to consume the vitality of the living, drawing strength from the very desolation of its home.That's a fantastic piece of lore to integrate! It immediately elevates Ash-runners from mere predatory beasts to intelligent, culturally significant inhabitants of the Scorlends. This suggests a species perfectly adapted not just biologically, but socially and technologically, to its harsh environment.
