A **Rock-hound** is the loyal, resilient companion of the Ash-runners, a creature forged by the unforgiving landscape of the Scorlends itself. It is a testament to rugged endurance and keen intelligence, perfectly suited to the harsh environment it shares with its nomadic masters.
Its physique is stout and powerfully muscled, a compact, low-slung form designed for unwavering stability and agile movement across fractured rock and shifting ash. Its 'coat' is not fur, but a unique hide composed of tightly packed, **mineral-infused plates or coarse, bristly growths** that mimic the texture and coloration of the surrounding terrain. It's a mottled tapestry of **charcoal grey, obsidian black, and rust-colored ochre**, allowing it to blend seamlessly with the scree and volcanic dunes. Jagged, rock-like protrusions might run along its spine or shoulders, adding to its formidable appearance and offering natural protection.
Its head is broad and powerful, framed by thick, leathery ears that are usually flattened close to its skull, protecting them from dust. Its most striking feature is its eyes: deep-set, intelligent, and often glowing with a faint, steady **ember-like orange or dull red luminescence**, perfectly adapted to piercing the dust-laden air. Its powerful jaws are lined with blunt, crushing teeth, capable of splintering bone or grinding difficult minerals. Its four strong limbs end in broad, clawed paws with incredibly tough, calloused pads that provide tenacious grip on even the steepest and most treacherous surfaces.
The Rock-hound moves with a grounded, sure-footed gait, its steps producing a low, rhythmic ***clack* of stone on stone** or a muffled pad on ash. When agitated, it emits a deep, guttural **rumble** that vibrates through the very ground, or a short, sharp bark that cuts through the profound silence of the wastes. It carries the clean, mineral scent of **dry rock and fine dust**, a scent that is almost indistinguishable from its home. Utterly loyal and fiercely protective, a Rock-hound is more than just a beast; it is a vital, intelligent partner in survival, a living tool and a steadfast companion in the desolation of the Scorlends.That's a perfect name to fit the Scorlends! A "Dust-wight" truly sounds like a spectral horror born from the desolation.
