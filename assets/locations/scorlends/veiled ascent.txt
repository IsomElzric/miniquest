The landscape here begins its true ascent, the ground twisting and rising as you push deeper into the Scorlends. 
The looming presence of the volcano, often obscured by haze from afar, now utterly dominates the horizon, its colossal peak a bruised, menacing silhouette. 
The ground underfoot is increasingly composed of solidified, jagged lava flows, like ancient, tortured rivers of black glass. 
The air grows noticeably hotter, pressing down on you with a dry, suffocating weight, and the acrid smell of sulfur intensifies with every step. 
The ever-present ochre sky above seems to deepen, almost to a charcoal grey, and occasionally, a faint, unsettling reddish glow can be glimpsed deep within the volcano's peak, like a monstrous, sleeping eye. 
Sparse, twisted trees with unnaturally black bark cling desperately to impossible slopes, their branches reaching like desperate, pleading hands. 
The silence is broken only by the rasp of your own breath and the occasional, deep, unsettling rumble from deep within the earth, a visceral reminder of the immense, dormant power that still stirs beneath your feet, threatening to awaken.
