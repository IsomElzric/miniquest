['Choaked oasis', 'Scavenger\'s ridge']
The relatively flat, broken ground gives way abruptly. 
Before you, the landscape erupts into a series of impossibly sharp, glass-like formations. 
They jut from the earth like colossal, shattered knives, black as night, yet catching the bruised light of the sky in disturbing, fractured glints. 
Some are needle-thin, others squat and brutal, but all seem to be made of solidified dread. 
The ground here is a chaotic, razor-sharp scree of black volcanic glass, every step a careful, crunching test of your boots. 
The air is still, but a chilling, almost musical whistle winds through the countless edges of the spires, a mournful song that carries with it distant, broken echoes, like the screams of a forgotten past. 
It's a place of unnerving, silent beauty and immediate, stark danger.
