['Choaked oasis', 'Sulphur wastes']
A slight rise in the endless undulations of stone and scree brings you to a disturbing sight: the heavily eroded and half-buried remnants of a small settlement. 
Most structures are little more than indistinct mounds of rubble, but you can discern the faint outlines of crumbling walls, a half-buried archway, or the shattered remains of what might have been a well. 
Everything here is coated in a thick, pervasive layer of fine, grey ash, like a shroud that has preserved a ghostly snapshot of its last moments. 
The air is heavy, almost solemn, and kicking up the ash reveals unsettling imprints - perhaps the outline of a body, or the grotesque shape of something monstrous that was consumed by the falling debris on that terrible day. 
The silence is profound, save for the whisper of the ash itself, which seems to sigh with the weight of forgotten horrors.
