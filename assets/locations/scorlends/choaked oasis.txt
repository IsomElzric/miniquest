['Obsidian spires', 'Scavenger\'s ridge', 'Ash-choked ruins']
The relentless, barren expanse of the Scorlends offers a deceptive dip in the distance, promising respite. 
As you approach, a sparse cluster of desperately struggling, thorny scrub and a few gnarled, sickly-looking trees come into view, an impossible splash of green in this desolate land. 
At its heart, a pool of water, murky and still, offers the tantalizing scent of minerals, barely enough to quell your thirst. 
The ground around it is churned earth and broken stone, heavily trafficked by countless feet, a silent testament to its vital importance. 
Crude markers, warnings etched into stone, and the cold ashes of old campfires litter the area, hinting at recent, often desperate, struggles. 
Despite the promise of life, an undercurrent of tension vibrates in the dry air; the quiet here is not peaceful, but wary, a silent watchfulness that tells you every drop of water in this wasteland comes with a price.
