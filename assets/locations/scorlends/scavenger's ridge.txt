['Obsidian spires', 'Choaked oasis']
The vast, flat desolation gives way to a series of craggy, sun-baked ridges and narrow, winding paths. 
This is the Scavenger's Ridge, a maze of perilous trails that offer both higher ground and treacherous footing. 
The slopes are not just rock; they are littered with the detritus of desperate lives: rusted tools, fragments of broken wagons, sun-bleached bones - some clearly humanoid - and tattered scraps of fabric caught on thorns, flapping like forgotten banners. 
Occasionally, a crude shelter, fashioned from scavenged metal sheets and torn canvas, clings precariously to a cliff face or tucks into a rocky alcove, a grim testament to the desperate measures taken for survival in this unforgiving land. 
The wind here is a constant, biting presence, whipping up stinging dust and carrying faint, metallic clangs from unseen camps, a constant reminder that you are being watched, and perhaps, hunted.
