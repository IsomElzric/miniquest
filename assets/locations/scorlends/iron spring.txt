['Scavenger\'s ridge']
[]
After enduring the relentless sun and stinging grit of the Scorlends, you crest a low rise to find The Iron Spring, a true miracle in this blasted land. 
It's a depression in the rock, almost like a natural basin, partially sheltered by an overhang of dark, igneous stone that blocks the direct brunt of the ember rain. 
At its center, a trickle of clear, cold water emerges from a fissure in the rock, collecting in a shallow poolâ€”pure and surprisingly untainted by sulfur. 
The ground here is hardened, packed earth, worn smooth by countless desperate feet, and crude, sun-bleached windbreaks of scavenged metal and canvas have been erected by previous travelers, offering flimsy but vital protection from the pervasive ash and biting winds. 
The constant, suffocating heat of the wasteland is softened here, and while the distant, bruised silhouette of the volcano still looms, its immediate fury feels momentarily held at bay, offering a desperate, precious haven.
