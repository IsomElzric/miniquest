['Obsidian spires']
[]
The oppressive, whispering embrace of the Aethelwood finally loosens its grip, spitting you out with an abruptness that's almost violent. 
One moment, you're tangled in its suffocating gloom; the next, the world explodes into a stark, brutal clarity.

Before you stretches the Scorlends, a vast, broken expanse of stone and ash. 
The ground here is less earth and more a chaotic jumble of jagged scree, fractured rock, and sudden, treacherous dunes of dark, volcanic sand. 
The air, no longer cool and damp, shimmers with a suffocating, dry heat that tastes of dust and ancient, burnt rock. 
The sky above is a perpetual, bruised ochre, a grim canvas against which the distant, jagged silhouette of the ancient Shadowsun volcano looms - a silent, monstrous testament to a forgotten cataclysm.

Vegetation is a cruel joke here: scattered patches of defiant, thorny scrub cling desperately to cracks in the stone, and occasional, stunted trees, twisted by unseen forces, stand like gallows against the barren horizon. 
The silence is profound, but it's not the living quiet of the forest; it's the dead hush of a place stripped bare, a silence that seems to absorb all sound, leaving only the rasp of your own breath and the crunch of unstable stone underfoot. 
The wind, when it comes, carries no relief, only stinging grit and the faint, unsettling scent of sulfur and extinction. 
There's no hiding here, no escape from the relentless, sun-baked truth of this blasted land.
