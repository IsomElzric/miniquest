['Choking crevasse']
The abrupt edge of the Scorlends gives way to a brutal, upward slope. 
You step onto the Ash-Blasted Scar, and the mountain immediately asserts its dominance. 
The ground here is a treacherous, constantly shifting incline of coarse, dark ash and fine volcanic grit that pulls at your boots with every step. 
The air, hot and caustic, stings your nostrils and burns your lungs, choked with the perpetual, stinging rain of embers and the thick, suffocating ash plume that blots out the sky. 
Visibility is poor, the world reduced to shades of grey and black, punctuated by the angry red glow of distant, unseen fires higher up. 
This is a landscape of fresh, raw wounds, where the mountain is actively bleeding ash, and the only sounds are the rasp of your own breathing and the relentless sift-sift-sift of falling debris. 
Here and there, a charred, half-buried shape hints at those who tried to escape or ascend too early, consumed by the mountain's relentless outpouring.
