['Choking crevasse', 'Obsidian labyrinth', 'Twisted catacombs']
The air grows searingly hot, thick with the smell of scorched rock and something raw, primal. 
The very ground here is a fractured, unstable crust, alive with danger. 
Glowing fissures and jagged cracks riddle the rock underfoot, from which raw, red magma oozes forth like festering, molten wounds. 
Small, new lava flows, slow and unstoppable, push their way across the landscape, forcing desperate detours or perilous leaps over churning inferno. 
The heat is overwhelming, radiating from every surface, an oppressive blanket that feels like a furnace. 
The constant sizzle of cooling rock and the ominous, heavy slurp of the moving magma fill the air, creating a terrifying, living soundscape that warns of the mountain's imminent, deadly power. 
Every step is a gamble, every breath a testament to your endurance against the mountain's bleeding heart.
