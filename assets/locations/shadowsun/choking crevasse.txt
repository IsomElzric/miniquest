['Ash-blasted scar', 'Obsidian labyrinth', 'Magma veins']
Your perilous climb along the steep, ash-covered slopes is abruptly interrupted. 
The ground simply ends, opening into a vast, terrifying tear in the earth. 
Its depths plunge out of sight, swallowed by the swirling ash and the infernal glow that filters up from unimaginable distances below. 
Crossing requires navigating a narrow, crumbling rock bridge that feels impossibly flimsy, or clinging to treacherous, brittle ledges that cling to the sheer walls of the abyss. 
The air trapped within the crevasse is even more stifling, thick with choking sulfurous gases that burn your eyes, and an unsettling, bone-chilling draft of cold, dense air seems to rise from its abyssal depths. 
The only sounds are the terrifying vastness of the empty space, and perhaps, from below, a faint, metallic chime or a mournful moan, just beyond the reach of rational thought, hinting at untold horrors in the unseen depths.
