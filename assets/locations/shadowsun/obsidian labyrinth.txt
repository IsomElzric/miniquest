['Choking crevasse', 'Magma veins']
Beyond the crevasse, the mountain transforms into a truly alien landscape. 
You find yourself trapped within the Obsidian Labyrinth, a chaotic, razor-sharp maze of massive, gleaming black volcanic glass. 
These aren't merely spires; they are intricate, towering walls and collapsed arches that twist into a confusing, dangerous network of narrow passages and disorienting dead ends. 
The ground is a treacherous mix of solid, smooth obsidian and loose, jagged shards that tear at your boots. 
The intense heat radiates off the dark rock, making the air shimmer with distorting waves, and the constant sifting of ash adds a macabre, grey dusting to every sharp edge. 
Every turn feels like a wrong turn, every reflection in the glassy walls seems to twist and leer, creating an overwhelming sense of being hunted, of unseen eyes watching from the polished black surfaces.
