['Ash-blasted scar']
The ground beneath your feet, already ravaged by the Scorlends' ancient fury, now slopes sharply upward. 
Before you, towering against a sky bruised not by clouds but by a perpetual, choking plume, looms Shadowsun Mountain. 
This is not merely a volcano; it is a monument to an active, seething rage.

The air here is a torment, thick with the smell of sulfur and superheated rock, constantly alight with a stinging rain of embers and coarse ash that burns your skin and grits in your teeth. 
Every gust of wind is a furnace blast, pushing you back, threatening to hurl you from the narrow, treacherous paths that cling to the mountainside. 
The ground itself is a terrifying, living thing: cracked earth groans underfoot, giving way without warning to bottomless chasms that inhale the light, revealing only the faint glow of unimaginable depths. 
Rivers of molten lava slither down ancient channels, hissing and churning, casting an infernal, pulsing light that paints the desolate slopes in hues of orange and black. 
In other places, the very rock weeps, as raw, red magma oozes from fissures, slow and unstoppable.

This is a place of absolute oppression, where the mountain itself seems to be alive, its fury a palpable presence. 
The creatures that inhabit this hellscape are not of the natural world, but twisted, hardened aberrations born of the mountain's infernal power. 
Every upward step is a desperate struggle against the mountain's wrath, a forced march into the very heart of the ancient evil that birthed the cataclysm, shattered Lastholm, and scattered its people into the desolate wastes. 
This is the source of all ruin, the end of all hope, and the beginning of the true reckoning.
