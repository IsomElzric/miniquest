['Shadowed residential blocks']
[]
After navigating the suffocating ruins, you stumble upon The Broken Hearth, a miraculously sheltered alcove within the carcass of what might have once been a grand villa in the residential blocks. 
Someone, or something, has cleared a small space here, using fallen masonry to reinforce a section of a crumbling wall, creating a crude but effective windbreak. 
A faint, acrid smell of damp rot still lingers, but it's largely masked by the faint scent of old, burnt wood from the central fire pit â€“ long cold, but testament to past warmth. 
The perpetual silence of Lastholm is noticeably muted here, the whispers of the city seeming to recede just beyond the reinforced barrier. 
It's a fragile peace, undoubtedly, and the pervasive shadows still press in from beyond the makeshift walls, but for now, the chilling gaze of the ruined city feels distant, offering a moment of precarious, desperate safety.
