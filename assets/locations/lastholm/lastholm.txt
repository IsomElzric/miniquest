As you finally break through the oppressive, blighted wilderness, Lastholm reveals itself, 
not with a grand vista, but as a gaping, jagged wound upon the landscape. 
It's a city not merely ruined, but decayed, its silhouette against the bruised sky a skeletal 
outline of jagged towers and collapsed roofs. 
A perpetual, sickly haze seems to cling to it, muting the already dull colors of crumbling stone and rusted iron.

The Front Gates, what little remains, gape like a broken maw, inviting you into the belly of a dead beast. 
Beyond them, the once-proud structures are reduced to hollow shells, their empty window-eyes staring out 
like countless, vacant sockets. 
You can discern the twisted, skeletal forms of dead trees from what might have been parks, their branches 
clawing at the sky, and the silent, broken spires of forgotten temples, a testament to lost faith. 
The distant, churning waters of what looks like a choked harbor seem to pulse with a dark, unwholesome sheen.

A profound, suffocating silence hangs over everything, broken only by the mournful whisper of the wind through 
desolate streets and the occasional, unsettling creak of collapsing stone. 
It's not the stillness of peace, but of a vast, unspoken horror, a stillness that screams of a life violently 
extinguished. 
Lastholm doesn't feel abandoned; it feels hollowed out, its very essence drained, leaving behind only the cold, 
grim husk of what once was. 
A single, unsettling thought takes root in your mind: this is not just a city of the dead, but perhaps a city 
that is itself a tomb.
