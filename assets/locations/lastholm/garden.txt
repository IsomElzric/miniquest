Stepping into the Weeping Gardens feels like intruding upon a grand, silent grief.
Once a place of serene beauty, it is now a tangled wilderness of thorny rose bushes grown wild and choked 
by parasitic vines.
Crumbling arbors, draped in heavy, dark ivy, weep cascades of dead leaves onto what were once pristine pathways.
The central fountain, its basin cracked and filled with stagnant, scummy water, is surrounded by grotesque,
calcified growths, giving the impression of ancient tears turned to stone.
The very atmosphere is thick with a melancholy, a pervasive sorrow that seeps from the overgrown earth and 
clings to the ancient, gnarled trees.
Sculptures of nymphs and heroes, now broken and defaced, peer out from tangles of thorns like tortured spirits.
This garden does not bloom; it mourns, and everything within it seems to be perpetually on the verge of collapsing 
under the weight of its own sorrow and the relentless, suffocating embrace of the wild.
