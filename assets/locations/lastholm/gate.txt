Before you, the Front Gates of Lastholm stand as a stark monument to a forgotten age and a crushing defeat. 
The remnants of a formidable wall, now mostly collapsed into jagged teeth of masonry, flank the main entry. 
The gates themselves are a testament to the city's dying throes; immense, spiked portcullis bars, frozen halfway down, are caked in centuries of grime and rust, their razor-sharp tips pointing impotently at the ground. 
Beyond them, a glimpse into the city reveals only further ruin: choked streets, skeletal buildings reaching towards a perpetually overcast sky, and an unsettling stillness that swallows all sound. 
The silence is not peaceful, but rather a suffocating weight, broken only by the occasional distant creak or groan from the crumbling structures, like the city itself sighing its last, long breath.
