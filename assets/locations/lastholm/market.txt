The Shattered Market Quarter of Lastholm is a testament to hurried, desperate flight. Once, its cobblestones would have echoed with the clamor of trade; now, they are choked with a century of refuse, broken timber from collapsed stalls, and an insidious carpet of black moss that seems to drink the very light. The air hangs thick with the ghost of commerce â€“ a cloying scent of damp rot, mildewed fabric, and the faint, unsettling sweetness of something long-dead. Rusted coin trays lie overturned like accusing tongues, spilling nothing but dust and shattered ceramic shards. Here and there, a forgotten toy or a child's shoe peeks from beneath the detritus, a sudden, sharp pang amidst the pervasive decay. This is the domain of scavengers, human and worse, who pick through the bones of what was, their furtive movements the only life in this choked graveyard of goods.
