The Shadowed Residential Blocks are where Lastholm truly died, not with a roar, but with a choked whisper. Here, rows of once-neat homes stand as gaping shells, their roofs collapsed inward like shattered skulls and their walls riddled with holes that gape like vacant eyes. The narrow streets between them are treacherous with fallen debris – broken roof tiles, shattered window glass crunching underfoot, and the unidentifiable remains of household goods. An unsettling stillness hangs in the air, a profound silence broken only by the mournful creak of a loose shutter or the whisper of the wind through a broken doorway, carrying with it the faint, cloying scent of damp wood, mildewed fabric, and something indistinctly organic—the scent of long-dead dreams. Within the ruined interiors, glimpses of past lives remain: a child's forgotten doll half-buried in dust, a teacup sitting cracked on a toppled table, a rusted cooking pot still clinging to a sooty hearth. Each is a chilling testament to lives abruptly ended, a snapshot of normalcy frozen in a moment of unimaginable horror. The shadows here are particularly deep, clinging to every alcove and corner, seeming to lengthen and shift as if something unseen observes from their depths.
