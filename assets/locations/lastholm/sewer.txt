The entrance to Lastholm's Sewers is often a collapsed grate in a shadowed alley, a gaping maw of damp earth beneath a crumbling cellar, or a narrow, slick tunnel leading down from a blighted street. 
The moment you descend, the world above ceases to exist. 
The air assaults you immediately: a suffocating, churning cocktail of stagnant water, raw sewage, trapped gases, and something distinctly metallic, like the coppery tang of old blood. 
The walls, slick with black slime and glistening with unidentifiable moisture, narrow into claustrophobic passages, twisting and turning into a lightless labyrinth. 
Water drips endlessly from unseen leaks above, echoing in the oppressive silence, each drop amplified into a chillingly deliberate sound. 
This is where the city's waste collects, but also where its darkest secrets fester; forgotten vaults, ancient cultic chambers, or the lairs of creatures that thrive only in absolute, suffocating darkness. 
The ground beneath your feet is a treacherous muck of unseen refuse, and every step is a gamble, knowing what might be stirred from the depths.
