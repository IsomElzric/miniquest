['Whispering thicket', 'Mire of silent reflections']
['Gnarled horror', 'Lore-ghost']
The oppressive density of the Aethelwood thins slightly, and you step into a clearing that holds an unnatural, chilling stillness. 
Here, the trees are not merely ancient; they are turning to stone. 
Their trunks are craggy, grey rock, and their branches, thick as your arm, are stiff and brittle, their leaves like jagged, petrified shards that crumble to dust with the slightest touch. 
Despite their stony nature, an eerie sense of arrested motion pervades the grove, as if caught in a final, agonizing transformation. 
Scattered amongst them, partially absorbed into the stony ground, are grotesque figures that were once animals, or perhaps even people, their forms rigid and cold, their faces locked in silent horror or an unsettling, serene acceptance. 
The whispers here are different; clearer, more focused, but no less unsettling - fragments of ancient languages, sorrowful laments, or stark warnings that fade just as their meaning begins to coalesce in your mind. 
An unnatural calm hangs in the air, a deceptive peace that feels colder than any breeze, hinting at the profound, horrifying stillness of utter cessation.
