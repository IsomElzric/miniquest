['Sunken watchtower', 'Scorlends']
The Aethelwood seems to culminate here, in a space that defies comprehension. 
This is not a clearing, nor a simple grove. 
At its center stands an impossibly ancient tree, its trunk a swirling vortex of dark, pulsating bark, seeming to ripple with unseen energies. 
Or perhaps it's a vast, circular expanse where the very air shimmers with an alien, vibrant hum. 
The ground beneath your feet is no longer earth but a strange, unyielding surface, covered in intricate, non-Euclidean patterns of glowing moss that shift and reform before your eyes, or faint, ethereal runes that pulse with a cold, inner light. 
Here, the whispers of ancient knowledge are no longer whispers. 
They are a deafening, ceaseless torrent of incomprehensible information, crashing against your mind like a storm surge, overwhelming every sense. 
It's too much, too alien, too vast to grasp, a terrifying deluge of knowing that threatens to shatter the fragile confines of your sanity. 
Shadows here fall in impossible directions, and sounds seem to originate from nowhere, creating a sense of utter disorientation and the terrifying realization that you have stumbled upon the very core of this living, malevolent intelligence.
