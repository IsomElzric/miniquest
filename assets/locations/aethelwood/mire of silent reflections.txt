['Grove of hungering vines', 'Petrified grove', 'Sunken watchtower']
The ground beneath your feet suddenly softens, becoming spongy and then slick with an unwholesome dampness. 
You find yourself in a low-lying section of the Aethelwood, a vast, shallow mire where the dark, murky water stretches out between the trees, reflecting the oppressive canopy with unnerving clarity. 
Every twisted, skeletal tree emerging from the depths has a perfect, still mirror image below, making it difficult to discern where reality ends and reflection begins. 
The air is thick with the stagnant scent of decay and damp earth, heavy enough to taste. 
As you cautiously navigate the treacherous tangle of unseen roots beneath the water's surface, the whispers here become personal. 
They no longer assault you with a multitude of voices, but seem to speak directly to your mind, echoing your own doubts, replaying forgotten mistakes, and twisting past regrets into fresh anxieties. 
You glance at your reflection in the still water, and for a terrifying moment, it seems to hold a life of its own, subtly shifting, distorting, or showing something utterly alien staring back.
