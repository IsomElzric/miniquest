['Petrified grove']
[]
The oppressive whispers and shifting paths of the Aethelwood abruptly yield to The Quiet Glade, a small, almost unnaturally serene clearing. 
Here, the gnarled trees that dominate the forest seem to turn their backs, their lowest branches pulling away as if respecting some invisible boundary. 
The usual cacophony of indiscernible voices that plagues the Aethelwood is reduced to a barely perceptible hum, a faint, distant murmur that no longer claws at your sanity. 
The ground is remarkably free of the gnarled roots and suffocating moss, instead offering a bed of soft, dry leaves. 
A ring of smooth, grey stones encircles a central spot, hinting at others who sought refuge here. 
The air is still, no longer thick with the forest's unsettling static, offering a profound, if temporary, mental respite. 
For this fleeting moment, the forest seems to hold its breath, allowing you a fragile peace within its heart.
