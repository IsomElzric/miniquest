['Whispering thicket']
The crumbled archway where the Temple District's outer wall has finally succumbed offers a stark transition. 
One moment, you stand amidst the choked silence and broken stones of Lastholm; the next, you step into a profound, suffocating stillness.

Before you, the Aethelwood rises, not as a collection of trees, but as a colossal, ancient, and impossibly dark entity. 
Its canopy is so dense, so interwoven, that it devours the sky entirely, reducing the already dim daylight to a perpetual twilight that presses in from all sides. 
The trees themselves are unlike any you've seen: their bark is a deep, bruised purple or a mottled grey, incredibly gnarled and thick, while their branches twist and interlock like skeletal fingers, forming an impenetrable, living wall. 
The air here is instantly colder, thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and something else - something sharp and metallic, like static, or old memory.

There's no clear path, only narrow, shadowed gaps between the ancient trunks that seem to shift even as you look at them. 
The ground beneath your feet is a soft, unnerving carpet of centuries of fallen leaves, making every step eerily silent, save for a faint, almost imperceptible whisper that seems to rise from the very air itself. 
It's not the rustle of wind, but a myriad of hushed, unintelligible voices, just beyond the reach of understanding, like a million forgotten secrets trying to break free. 
A profound sense of being watched, of being expected, settles over you. 
This isn't merely a forest; it's a colossal, patient mind, and you have just stepped into its labyrinthine thoughts. 
The way back, you realize with a sudden, chilling certainty, already seems to have vanished behind you, swallowed by the shifting shadows of the Aethelwood.
