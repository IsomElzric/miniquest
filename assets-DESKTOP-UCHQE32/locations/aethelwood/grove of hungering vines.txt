The way forward becomes a struggle. 
You find yourself amidst a terrifyingly claustrophobic section of the forest, dominated by thick, cable-like vines that coil and weave through the ancient trees like colossal, patient serpents. 
They are not merely plant life; their surfaces are rough, almost scaly, and an unnerving perception settles upon you that they are moving, tightening their grip with slow, deliberate purpose. 
They crush the ancient trunks, leaving deep indentations, and blanket the ground in a dense, treacherous net of roots and their own relentless growth. 
Progress is agonizingly slow, each step a battle against their entangling grip. 
The air here is heavy, rich with the scent of dark earth and something strangely animalistic, like the warm, damp breath of a hidden predator. 
The whispers are no longer voices, but a constant, sibilant hiss, a rustling that sounds like myriad tiny mouths tearing at something, a hungry, ceaseless murmur that promises slow consumption.
