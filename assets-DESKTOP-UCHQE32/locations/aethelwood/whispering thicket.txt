['Petrified grove', 'Grove of hungering vines']
['Whisper-weaver', 'Shadow-wight']
You push through a curtain of impossibly thick, twisted branches, and the world immediately compresses around you. 
This isn't just dense forest; it's a living, suffocating labyrinth. 
Trees with bark like old, scarred leather grow so close together you can barely squeeze between them, their gnarled limbs interweaving overhead to form a canopy that swallows even the Aethelwood's pervasive twilight. 
The path you thought you were following vanishes behind you, replaced by a wall of indistinguishable foliage. 
Every step on the thick, spongy carpet of moss and unseen roots feels unnervingly silent, almost as if the ground itself is absorbing your presence. 
And then the sounds begin. 
It's not the wind, nor the rustle of leaves, but a ceaseless, indistinct whisper rising from every direction at once. 
A thousand hushed voices, just beyond the edge of understanding, murmuring, sighing, pleading, mocking - all just out of reach, yet pressing in on your mind with a suffocating weight. 
The air itself feels thick with unseen presences, and a chilling certainty settles in your gut: you are hopelessly lost in a maze that may have no exit.
