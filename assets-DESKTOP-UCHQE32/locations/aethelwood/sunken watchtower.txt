Against the endless, oppressive wall of the Aethelwood, a shape emerges, unnatural in its straight lines and cold stone: the collapsing remnants of an ancient watchtower. 
It rises from a slight depression in the earth, its lower levels seemingly swallowed by the encroaching forest and the ground itself. 
Thick, emerald moss blankets its crumbling stones, and ancient vines cling to its outer walls, giving it the appearance of being slowly devoured by the very woods it once stood sentinel against. 
The air here is strangely still, perhaps even colder, holding the faint scent of damp stone and something vaguely metallic, like old armor or forgotten fear. 
Inside, through a gaping breach where a wall has fallen, you can glimpse tangled debris and the rotted husks of what might have been ancient furnishings. 
The whispers here are more distinct, fragments of long-lost voices carried on the chill air, not of confusion, but of warning or despair - cryptic prophecies or the final, 
desperate cries of watchers long dead, seemingly still echoing from the stones, hinting at the futility of vigilance against the Aethelwood's relentless power.
