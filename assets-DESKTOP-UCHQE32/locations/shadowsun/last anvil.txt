['Magma veins']

The brutal ascent of Shadowsun culminates, for a perilous moment, in The Last Anvil. 
This isn't a clearing, but a cramped, almost entirely enclosed cavern, a natural pocket in the mountain's roaring heart, shielded from the direct onslaught of lava and ash. 
The air here is still scorching, thick with the smell of sulfur and superheated rock, but the constant, stinging rain of embers is mercifully absent. 
The walls pulse with the mountain's infernal glow, radiating oppressive heat, yet somehow, this small space offers a sliver of refuge. 
A rough, flat outcropping of cooled, obsidian-like rock in the center looks like a natural workbench, a stark testament to a desperate, perhaps final, preparation. 
The deafening thrum of the mountain's internal furnaces is muffled here, a deep, rhythmic bass that vibrates through your very bones, a constant, chilling reminder that you are deep within the beast. 
This is the final staging ground, a desperate, temporary reprieve before the inevitable confrontation with the ancient evil.
