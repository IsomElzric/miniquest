A dark, gaping entrance, impossibly carved into the sheer mountainside, beckons or perhaps compels you inward. 
You step into the Twisted Catacombs, and the roar of the mountain's open face is muffled, replaced by a suffocating, still silence. 
The air here is thick with extreme heat, the faint, sickly-sweet smell of long-dead things, and a heavy sulfurous tang. 
The tunnels stretch into unseen darkness, their walls a bizarre mix of unnaturally smooth, carved stone and rough, unworked rock that seems to have been grotesquely twisted and buckled by the volcano's internal pressure. 
In the dim light, you glimpse niches and alcoves, some containing the skeletal remains of those who fled here, fused into the rock, their forms locked in silent screams or desperate, final postures. 
This is a place of ancient, imprisoned despair, where the echoes of the mountain's wrath have settled into the very stone.
