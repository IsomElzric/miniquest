['Ash-choked ruins', 'Veiled ascent']
['Sulphur-crawler', 'Dust-wight']
As you push deeper into the Scorlends, the very ground changes, shifting from black and grey to a sickly yellow and orange, stained by virulent mineral deposits. 
The air itself grows thick and hot, becoming a suffocating haze of acrid steam and burning dust. 
Jets of noxious, superheated gas hiss from cracks in the earth all around you, carrying a choking stench of rotten eggs and scorched rock that burns your throat and lungs with every ragged breath. 
Nothing grows here, not even the hardiest scrub; it is a completely barren, hellish landscape, directly scarred by the volcano's ancient fury. 
The ground underfoot feels unnervingly warm, vibrating subtly, a constant, low thrum against your boots, a chilling reminder of the dormant power that slumbers just beneath the scorched surface.
